<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
We all have been looking for a place where we can sit and enjoy the music. After a hectic day, there is still a place where we can enjoy the peace. For some of us it's a Home, for some it's their loved ones.
<br />
>Quoting Jiraiya Sensei - <strong>A place where someone thinks about you is a place you can call Home</strong>
<br />
As we all have gone through a lot in this pandemic. So why not we just relax for a while and have a deep breath and just Relax.....
